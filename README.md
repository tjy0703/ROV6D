# ROV6D


We introduce a benchmark dataset, ROV6D, for 6D pose estimation of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). The proposed dataset includes the training synthetic data generation and the testing data collection in both a pool and the open lake at Maoming. The training subset consists of a large number of synthetic images with 6D ground-truth poses. The testing subsets, including the Pool subset and Maoming subset, focus on challenging cases with various levels of occlusion and visibility.
